##  IxOS and IxNetwork

Make sure IxOS and IxNetwork versions used on the AresONE hardware match the requirements for the DSE version you intend to run. See [Releases Notes](../kaidcb/versions.md) for compatibility information.

## DFE

Install "KAI Data Flow Emulation (DFE) for Keysight Hardware â€“ Chassis" component on each AresONE hardware unit via its Web Platform UI. See [Releases](../kaidcb/versions.md) for a download link. The file extension is `.waf`.
